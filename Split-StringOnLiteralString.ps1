# Split-StringOnLiteralString.ps1 contains one function (Split-StringOnLiteralString) that is
# designed to split a string the way the way that I expected it to be done - using a literal
# string (as opposed to regex). It's also designed to be backward-compatible with all versions
# of PowerShell and has been tested successfully on PowerShell v1. My motivation for creating
# this function was 1) I wanted a split function that behaved more like VBScript's Split
# function, 2) I do not want to be messing around with RegEx, and 3) I needed code that was
# backward-compatible with all versions of PowerShell.
